**Today, I've completed my Excel course. My experience with this online course is very positive. I've understood all things.**


_Earlier, I know that Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet program that's used to organize, analyze, and report on large amounts of data. But while learning this course I was amazed how Excel quickly make many calculations that would take a lot longer if done manually. The functions like SUM, PROPER, CONCATENATE, SUBSTITUTE and many more helps alot. We can also create 3D graphs and diagrams within seconds. Learning Excel was fun._

# Report of Induction Programme 
**First day (10 July 2024)**

Today was our first day at college, and we needed to arrive at the gurdwara sahib by 9 am. After the Ardas, we received parsad and proceeded to langar. The start of the day was very peaceful. Next, we headed to the auditorium to mark our attendance and find our seats. The induction program began with a warm welcome to all freshers by our principal and director. Additionally, alumni shared their experiences at GNE and their life journeys. We learned a lot about the college. Overall, the first day was as great as I had hoped.

**Second Day (11 July 2024)
