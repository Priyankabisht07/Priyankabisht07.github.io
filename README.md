**Today, I've completed my Excel course. My experience with this online course is very positive. I've understood all things.**


_Earlier, I know that Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet program that's used to organize, analyze, and report on large amounts of data. But while learning this course I was amazed how Excel quickly make many calculations that would take a lot longer if done manually. The functions like SUM, PROPER, CONCATENATE, SUBSTITUTE and many more helps alot. We can also create 3D graphs and diagrams within seconds. Learning Excel was fun._

Today was our first day at college, and we needed to arrive at the gurdwara sahib by 9 am. After the Ardas, we received parsad and proceeded to langar. The start of the day was very peaceful.

The first speaker of the day was the respected Dr. S.B. Singh. Unlike many other speakers, he didn’t just come and speak. His approach was unique and engaging. He guided us on how to better understand ourselves by conducting a thoughtful exercise. He instructed us to take a page from our notebook, write down our name, the place where we completed our studies, our percentage in the 12th examination, our address, and pin code. Additionally, he asked us to note our weaknesses and strengths.
Dr. Singh then gave us three minutes to envision a dream and write it on the page. After collecting all the pages, he helped us reflect on our hobbies, weaknesses, and strategies for overcoming challenges. This activity greatly enhanced our self-awareness and understanding of how to address our personal development.

Second speaker was Dr. Pushpinder Singh. He is a remarkable individual hailing from a family with a strong medical background. He possesses extensive knowledge, which he generously shared with us.
