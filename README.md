**Today, I've completed my Excel course. My experience with this online course is very positive. I've understood all things.**


_Earlier, I know that Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet program that's used to organize, analyze, and report on large amounts of data. But while learning this course I was amazed how Excel quickly make many calculations that would take a lot longer if done manually. The functions like SUM, PROPER, CONCATENATE, SUBSTITUTE and many more helps alot. We can also create 3D graphs and diagrams within seconds. Learning Excel was fun._
